# Fashion MNIST CNN Model Deployment ðŸ‘—ðŸ‘Ÿ

## Overview

This project demonstrates the development and deployment of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The trained model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to interactively test the model with custom images.

## Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories and a test set of 10,000 images. The categories include T-shirts/tops, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots.
